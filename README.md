# Breast Cancer Prediction Model

Breast Cancer Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains a breast cancer prediction model built using machine learning techniques. The model is deployed using Flask, providing a user-friendly web interface to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant.

## Model Details

The breast cancer prediction model is developed using a dataset containing various features extracted from breast tumor images. The model leverages state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to predict the diagnosis. For this project, we utilized the popular scikit-learn library to build and train the model.

## Dataset

The dataset used to train and test the model is obtained from a reliable source (mention the source, like UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle). It consists of labeled samples with features related to breast tumor characteristics.

## Requirements

To run the Flask application and use the breast cancer prediction model, you need the following dependencies:

- Python
- Flask 
- scikit-learn 
- pandas 
- numpy 

You can install the required packages using `pip`. For example:

```bash
pip install flask scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-prediction.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd breast-cancer-prediction
```

3. Run the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

4. Once the Flask app is running, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the breast cancer prediction interface.

5. Enter the required tumor features in the provided input fields and click the "Predict" button to get the prediction result.
